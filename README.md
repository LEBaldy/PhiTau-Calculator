Estimate Phi*Tau, Tau, and Phi Calculator for [Exponential Idle](https://conicgames.github.io/exponentialidle/) with calculations and data from [Phi*Tau Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lz_V0rCr3usm1Wyqn2DEJdw6_7lhWIxXCYFmUbArV1c/edit#gid=38800412):

###   Purpose:

The calculator outputs the estimated Phi*Tau, Tau, and Phi of an input F(t). This is merely a lookup calculator and can be wrong depending on situation (especially lower F(t) below ee14000 and above ee5000).

###   Data and Calculations:

The calculator and linked google sheets was made by [LE⭐Baldy](https://github.com/LEBaldy) with data contributions from the entire community. To add more data and make the calculator more accurate, please contirbute to [Phi*Tau Sheet Contribution Form](https://forms.gle/rEV4ytYYudM44qT66). Full unfiltered data, besides color sorted for section, can be found on the [Data Collections Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_E_WaIdQ8JZ1z7ntCCST9chE25Bk4u-5CB7i7jd_9xM/edit?usp=sharing).

###   Distribution:

This code will not work locally without the nessasary .json file, but for security reasons, it will not be publically made available. However, the code will be hosted shortly on the [Exponential Idle Discord](https://discord.gg/S9UheTC) for use. If you want usage without going through the bot you can message me for me to run it locally.
